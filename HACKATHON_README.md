## Executive Summary

The **Qiskit Fall Fest 2026 Flagship Hackathon** is an elite two-phase quantum computing competition built on the theme of **Algorithm-Architecture Co-Design**. Rather than treating quantum hardware as an abstract, idealized black box, participating teams must formulate, simulate, and benchmark quantum algorithms against concrete physical topologies (Processors A, B, and C) before designing their own custom **12-qubit Processor D** coupling map that directly resolves algorithmic bottlenecks.

This document serves as the master specification containing every track, all 20 technical problem statements, the 100-point evaluation rubric, hardware specifications, and an architectural breakdown of every section in the web application (`/learning/hackathon`).
