## Overview

This repository contains the production source code for the official website of **Qiskit Fall Fest 2026 at SRM University-AP (Amaravati)**.

Built to international quantum symposium standards as part of IBM Quantum's global network of 200+ host institutions, the platform powers SRM University-AP's flagship festival edition—delivering interactive schedules, campus wayfinding, event catalogues, and speaker registries across 59 curated events.

### Production Endpoints & Campus Access

* **Primary Custom Domain (`qffsrmap2026.com`):** Serves global public traffic, search engine crawlers, and external visitors. Protected by Cloudflare and Vercel.
* **Campus Direct Mirror (`qis-kit-fall-fest-2026.vercel.app`):** Direct Vercel production deployment. Use this URL for distribution on the SRM University-AP campus network and for registration links in campus groups. Because the campus Check Point firewall sinkholes newly registered domains like `qffsrmap2026.com` to `62.0.58.94` (`ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR`), the `.vercel.app` mirror provides 100% reliable, zero-configuration access for students and faculty across all campus Wi-Fi access points and labs.
* **Developer Client Bypass:** Developers on campus Wi-Fi can access `qffsrmap2026.com` directly by enabling **Secure DNS (DoH)** in their browser (`chrome://settings/security` -> select Cloudflare 1.1.1.1 or Google Public DNS).

## AI Agent & Developer Operating Protocol

All contributors and AI agents working on this platform must follow the guidelines codified in [PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md](PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md):

1. **The Caution Principle:** Never assume dates, venues, or rules. Verify against the companion Planning Repository or consult organizers.
2. **Anti-Slop Standards:** Strictly zero decorative emojis in UI, code, or commits. Clean, modern light theme by default (`#ffffff` / `#f8fafc`, subtle `#e2e8f0` borders, `#0f172a` text).
3. **External Registration CTA:** All registration CTAs point exclusively to the official Unstop portal once live. Internal `/register` or `/join` routes are strictly prohibited.
4. **Data Centralization:** Event data, schedules, and locations reside in `data/`. Do not hardcode static event data inside UI render components.
5. **Continuous Logging:** Record all significant updates in the Chronological Agent Log in `PROJECT_LEARNINGS.md`.
